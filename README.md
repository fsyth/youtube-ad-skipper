##### A Chrome extension that automatically closes banner ads and clicks 'Skip Ad' buttons for you.

An alternative to AdBlock, specifically for YouTube.

Instead of completely blocking ads which prevents YouTube channels from earning any ad revenue, this extension detects ads appearing and clicks the skip button instantly, just like a regular user would, only much quicker and effortlessly.

It doesn't block ads, it just clicks close and skip for you automatically. Useful if you're tabbed out, or just lazy.

For banner ads, it clicks the close button - usually before the ad is even visible.
For pre-roll ads that you have to watch for 5 seconds, it will click the skip button as soon as it can.


##### New in version 0.4

Added the Force Skip button (next to the the search bar). This allows you to manually skip ads in the rare cases when ads are not automatically detected. It also has the useful side-effect of skipping 'Sign in to view this video' age restrictions.

Added the ability to prevent Ad Skipper from skipping a pre-roll ad. Simply hold Ctrl as the Skip button countdown reaches zero. Because sometimes you're actually interested in an ad.
